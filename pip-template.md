## Abstract
<!--A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.-->
Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the PIP followed by a short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.

## Motivation
<!--The motivation should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the PIP solves. PIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->
The motivation should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the PIP solves. PIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.

## Specification & Rationale
<!--The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow interoperable implementations. The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work.-->

## Backwards Compatibility
<!--All PIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The PIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. PIP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.-->

## Test Cases & Implementation
<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for PIPs that are affecting consensus changes. Other PIPs can choose to include links to test cases if applicable. The implementations must be completed before any PIP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the PIP is accepted.-->
