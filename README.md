# PIP Status Terms
* **Draft** - a PIP that is undergoing rapid iteration and changes.
* **Last Call** - a PIP that is done with its initial iteration and ready for review by a wide audience.
* **Accepted** - a core PIP that has been in Last Call for at least 2 weeks and any technical changes that were requested have been addressed by the author. The process for Core Devs to decide whether to encode a PIP into their clients as part of a hard fork is not part of the PIP process. If such a decision is made, the PIP wil move to final.
* **Final (non-Core)** - a PIP that has been in Last Call for at least 2 weeks and any technical changes that were requested have been addressed by the author.
* **Final (Core)** - a PIP that the Core Devs have decided to implement and release in a future hard fork or has already been released in a hard fork. 
* **Deferred** - a PIP that is not being considered for immediate adoption. May be reconsidered in the future for a subsequent hard fork.
